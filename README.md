# JourneyCapture

Lets an MCP-aware AI assistant see and drive a real Windows desktop — take
screenshots, move the mouse, click, and type — the same way a human would, so it can
carry out on-screen tasks in apps that have no API of their own. Remote-controls
Windows desktops (mouse, keyboard, screenshots) through three components:

```
MCP client  --stdio/HTTP-->  MCP server  --HTTP-->  broker  <--WebSocket--  thin client(s)
```

- **Thin client** (`journeycapture`) — runs on each Windows box, drives the mouse/
  keyboard/screenshots there. Connects *out* to the broker; doesn't accept inbound
  connections.
- **Broker** (`journeycapture-broker`) — routes requests to whichever machine they're
  addressed to. One broker can relay to many thin clients at once.
- **MCP server** (`journeycapture-mcp`) — exposes the broker's API as MCP tools for
  an MCP-aware assistant.

Each runs on its own machine (thin client: the Windows box; broker and MCP server:
typically the controller machine, though nothing requires that).

Set these up in order: the broker first (everything else connects to it), then the
thin client(s), then the MCP server.

## Broker

Sits between the MCP server and every thin client.

```
uv sync --extra broker
cp examples/config.broker.example.json broker_config.json
# edit broker_config.json: set api_key and a machine_id/api_key pair per thin client
uv run journeycapture-broker --config broker_config.json
```

See [docs/BROKER.md](docs/BROKER.md) for the HTTP API and how routing works.

### TLS (optional)

Off by default — plaintext is fine as long as every leg stays on a trusted network.
Turn it on when a thin client or the MCP server needs to reach the broker across a
network you don't fully trust:

```
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -sha256 -days 3650 -nodes \
  -keyout broker_key.pem -out broker_cert.pem \
  -subj "/CN=journeycapture-broker" \
  -addext "subjectAltName=IP:<broker's real LAN IP>"
openssl x509 -in broker_cert.pem -noout -fingerprint -sha256
```

Set `tls_cert_file`/`tls_key_file` in `broker_config.json` to those two paths, then
give every client (thin client's `broker_tls`+`broker_cert_fingerprint`, MCP
server's `broker_scheme: "https"`+`broker_cert_fingerprint`, or
`scripts/testing/*.py --broker-scheme https --broker-cert-fingerprint ...`) the fingerprint
the second command printed. See [docs/BROKER.md](docs/BROKER.md)'s "TLS setup"
section for the full explanation (why a self-signed cert + pinned fingerprint
instead of a CA, and what to do if the cert is ever regenerated).

### Broker-pushed config

The broker is the recommended place to set operational config centrally, instead
of hand-editing every thin client / the MCP server's own local copy — the more
that lives in one place, the less there is to keep in sync across machines. Add
`machine_profiles` (per-`machine_id`: `screenshot`/`log_level`) and/or
`mcp_profile` (`save_screenshots`/`screenshot_dir`/`max_saved_screenshots`/
`timeout`) to `broker_config.json` and it's pushed to clients automatically (thin
clients on every connect, the MCP server once at startup). A client's own local
config is the fallback, not the primary source: a field a profile doesn't mention
keeps whatever the client's local value already was, and a broker that's briefly
unreachable at startup just leaves the MCP server on local settings with a
warning rather than refusing to start. Only settings with no bearing on *finding
or trusting* the broker are eligible for this — credentials and the broker's own
address always stay local. See [docs/BROKER.md](docs/BROKER.md)'s "Broker-pushed
config" section for the full design.

## Running the thin client from source

```
uv sync
cp examples/config.example.json config.json
# edit config.json: set broker_host/machine_id/api_key to match the broker's config
uv run journeycapture
```

Config is loaded from (in order): `--config PATH`, the `JOURNEYCAPTURE_CONFIG` env
var, or `config.json` next to the executable/CWD.

## Building the Windows executable

See [docs/WINDOWS_BUILD.md](docs/WINDOWS_BUILD.md) — must be built on Windows.
Manual verification checklist: [docs/WINDOWS_SMOKE_TEST.md](docs/WINDOWS_SMOKE_TEST.md).

## MCP server

```
uv sync --extra mcp
uv run journeycapture-mcp --config scripts/mcp/mcp_config.json
```

See [docs/MCP_SERVER.md](docs/MCP_SERVER.md) for configuration options, the `machine`
parameter every tool takes, and wiring it into an MCP client.

## Adding a new agent for another OS

The broker doesn't care what OS or language an agent is written in — only that it
speaks its WebSocket protocol and always connects *out* to the broker, never the
reverse. See [docs/THIN_AGENT_PLAYBOOK.md](docs/THIN_AGENT_PLAYBOOK.md) for the exact
wire protocol and a recipe for writing a Linux/macOS/other agent that plugs into
this same broker alongside `journeycapture_windows_thinclient`.
